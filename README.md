# Haskell Game Library

To run a simple test:

    cabal configure
    cabal run

The Haskell Game Library is an experimental 3D game engine written in Haskell.  The hope is to create a framework that will allow quick and easy creation of full featured cross-platform 3D video games.  It will provide all the libraries needed to make a video game including: graphics, physics, audio, networking and user interface.  

This project started as a way to keep myself occupied during my time off from college.  A few years ago I started learning Haskell and I fell in love with it.  Every time I have to write a program in one of my classes in Java, C++, or Matlab, I think how much better it would be to write it in Haskell.  I don't like how much imperative programming languages are used in most, if not all, commercial applications.  I felt that a good way to bring it into public use would be to create a library for creating commercial video games.  I hope to have a finished library at the end of this semester.
